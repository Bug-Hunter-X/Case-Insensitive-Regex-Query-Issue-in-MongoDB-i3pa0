# Case-Insensitive Regex Query Issue in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with case-insensitive regex queries in MongoDB and provides a solution.

## Issue Description

The use of case-insensitive regular expressions (using the `i` flag) in MongoDB find queries can unexpectedly fail to match documents. This issue is often difficult to diagnose because it depends on the specific regex pattern and data. 

## Solution

The problem might arise from an incorrect regex or some specific characters used in the query.  Carefully review your regular expression to check for problems.  If possible, use explicit case-insensitive comparison operators when possible.

## Code Samples

The `bug.js` file contains an example query that may not work as expected due to the regex behavior. The solution can be found in `bugSolution.js`.
